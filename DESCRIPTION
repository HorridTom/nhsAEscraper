Description: NHS England publishes monthly aggregated data on volume and
    4 hour target performance by acute Trust, in the form of MS Excel
    workbooks. Such a format does not facilitate statistical analysis,
    especially over time. This package scrapes the data and organises
    it into a coherent structure.
