Description: NHS England publishes monthly aggregated data on A&E attendance numbers and
    4 hour target performance by provider organisation, in the form of MS Excel
    workbooks. This format does not facilitate statistical analysis,
    especially over time. This package scrapes the data and organises
    it into a coherent structure.
