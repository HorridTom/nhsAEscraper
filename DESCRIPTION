Description: NHS England publishes monthly aggregated data on A&E attendance numbers and
    4 hour target performance by provider organisation, in the form of MS Excel
    workbooks. This format does not facilitate statistical analysis,
    especially over time. NHS Scotland provides weekly data as a .csv file.
    This package scrapes the data and organises it into a coherent structure.
